## Need Knower Definition

A Need Knower is defined as an individual living with a disability or who has an intimate understanding of their unmet needs. A Need Knower is typically an individual with a disability, their parent/family, or a physical/occupational therapist. TOM: Vanderbilt works with Need Knowers of all ages, from toddlers to seniors!
