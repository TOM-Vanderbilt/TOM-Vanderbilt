## 2025 Go Baby Go
This spring, TOM: Vanderbilt will be hosting a “Go Baby Go” event, where Makers will come together to adapt electric children's cars into mobility devices for children with disabilities. The adaptation will take place on two days (Sunday, 3/23 and Sunday, 4/6), and Makers are invited to be a part of both or either day. A third day, _____, will be the delivery day. Applications are due by **March 7th, 11:59pm** and all applicants will be **notified by March 17th.** Unlike the Makeathon, this is a skill and experience-based application. **You must be available for either March 23rd or April 6th to apply.**<br>
