## Date: March 23, April 6, and April 13, 2025<br>

# About

After solidifying the instructions from the five cars built so far, TOM: Vanderbilt held its first series of Go Baby Go build parties where members outside of exec could apply to participate in adapting a Go Baby Go Car. This spring, we had four Need Knowers: Hutch, Knox, Ángel, and PJ. 

## Day 1 - Disassembly & Kill Switch

During the first build party, teams were tasked with disassembling and rewiring the back of the car. This involved adding a relay for electrical safety and a kill switch so that parents could immediately shut off the car.

{% include gallery id="galleryd11" %}

{% include gallery id="galleryd12" %}

On the blue car, the kill switch was placed on the back windshield. On the black trucks, the kill switch was placed on the back right side of the car since the door to the truck bed collapsed down. 

{% include gallery id="galleryd13" %}

At the end of the build party, all four cars were operating properly! The car could only be turned on when the kill switch was open, and if the kill switch was closed, the front on/off button was powerless.

## Day 2 - Go Button & Reassembly

During the second build party, teams were tasked with rewiring the front of the car and reassembling the car. This involved adding a relay for electrical safety and a large "Go" button that the kids could use to make the car move.

{% include gallery id="galleryd21" %}

{% include gallery id="galleryd22" %}

The wires that were originally connected to the gas pedal were cut and rewired to the Go button. Each button was made with three 3D printed pieces, an internal mushroom button, springs, and screws. The springs could be adjusted to make the button more sensitive if the kids couldn't press as hard. 

{% include gallery id="galleryd23" %}

At the end of the build party, all four cars were completely electrically modified! With the Go button in place, each car is now much more accessible for children who wouldn't be able to activate a traditional gas pedal.

## Day 3 - Delivery Day!

### Car 1: Hutch

Hutch is a 2.5-year-old with Down syndrome, congenital heart disease, and a G-tube. He is able to crawl and scoot, but cannot yet walk.  

{% include gallery id="galleryh" %}

Hutch's car was modified to include a 5-point harness and head/back support. Along with his custom license plate, he was able to decorate his car to be Mickey Mouse themed - his favorite character!


{% include gallery id="galleryhd" %}

### Car 2: Knox

Knox is a 22-month-old. He was born with cytomegalovirus (CMV), which has caused growth delays. His family is expecting him to be diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he turns 2. While he can crawl some and pull to stand, Knox struggles with balance.

{% include gallery id="galleryk" %}

Knox was the smallest kid we worked with this semester, so he received a smaller Mercedes rather than the Ford truck the other kids received. Knox's car was modified to include a 5-point harness and head/back support. His car was then decorated with a Mickey Mouse-themed license plate and additional stickers!

{% include gallery id="gallerykd" %}

### Car 3: Ángel

Ángel is a 2.5-year-old who stopped developing cognitively at 12 months and eats through a feeding tube. He is able to crawl and pull himself to a standing position. Ángel is the first Need Knower we've worked with whose family speaks Spanish! 

{% include gallery id="gallerya" %}

Ángel's car was modified to include a 5-point harness and head/back support. He really likes farm animals, so his car was decorated to be a cow!

{% include gallery id="galleryad" %}

### Car 4: PJ

PJ is a 6-year-old with myotonic dystrophy. He is the size of a typical 4-year-old, and gets tired quickly from walking due to his weak muscles. 

{% include gallery id="galleryp" %}

PJ's car was modified to include a head/back support. Additionally, his Go button was secured more strongly to the steering wheel so that he could use it to help him steer the car. PJ's favorite show is Sesame Street, so his car was completed with a Sesame Street-style license plate!
