# About

After solidifying the instructions from the five cars built so far, TOM: Vanderbilt held its first series of Go Baby Go build parties where members outside of exec could apply to participate in adapting a Go Baby Go Car. This spring, we had four Need Knowers: Hutch, Knox, Ángel, and BJ. 

## Day 1 - Disassembly & Kill Switch

During the first build party, teams were tasked with disassembling and rewiring the back of the car. This involved adding a relay for electrical safety and a kill switch so that parents could immediately shut off the car.

On the blue car, the kill switch was placed on the back windshield. On the black trucks, the kill switch was placed on the back right side of the car since the door to the truck bed collapsed down.

At the end of the build party, all four cars were operating properly! The car could only be turned on when the kill switch was open, and if the kill switch was closed, the front on/off button was powerless.
