# About

This year, we hosted over 75 participants, including Makers, Need Knowers, and Team Leads, at our 5th annual Makeathon. We had 10 teams working throughout the weekend to prototype solutions for their Need Knowers.<br>

The weekend culminated in a showcase where each team was able to present about the work they completed. Read more about the 2022 Makeathon projects below!


# Projects

## Team 1 - Amy & Stephen

**Team Lead: Rebecca Pan**<br>

Amy and Stephen are graduate students at Vanderbilt studying audiology. They work with students with hearing loss who have difficulty hearing in the engineering labs. Amy and Stephen wanted to reduce background noise and reverberation, as well was incorporate a closed captioning system, to improve accessibility for those with hearing loss.

{% include gallery id="gallery1" %}

Team 1 tested acoustic paneling and determined that 8 panels per room provided the ideal decrease in background noise and reverberation. They also created an electrical system consisting of a microphone that inputs into a transmitter, receiver, and inputs into a closed captioning system. The closed captioning system, Otter.ai, allows for the input of engineering terms so that it can recognize those words more accurately when spoken. The accessible classroom documentation can be found here: [Accessible Classroom Documentation](https://tomglobal.org/project?id=6362e89b8694e63637185957).

## Team 2 - Sara

**Team Lead: Marin Schiffman**<br>

Sara is a Vanderbilt student who was diagnosed with 100% hearing loss in her right ear in kindergarten. She struggles with driving because she cannot hear the person in the passenger seat over the music playing and paying attention to the road. She has tried cross-over hearing aids, but finds them too embarrassing to wear. Sara needed a device to transfer the sound from the passenger seat to the left side of the driver seat.

## Team 3 - Allie

**Team Lead: Alex Sargent Capps**<br>

Allie has ALS, a neurodegenerative condition that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. She is paralyzed in her arms, making it difficult to put on jackets. Allie wanted a cape-like coat designed for the winter so that she could put it on and take it off independently. She specifically wanted the coat to be neutral colored and made of heavy-weighted material such as fleece or wool.

## Team 4 - Alicia & Chelsea

**Team Lead: Daniel Rau**<br>

Alicia and Chelsea are two friends with cerebral palsy, a condition that affects their fine motor skills, specifically with their fingers. Grabbing items is very difficult for them, and traditional grabbers don't work well enough since their fingers are stiff and difficult to move. Alicia and Chelsea needed a grabber that could be operated without fine motor skills.

{% include gallery id="gallery4" %}

Alicia and Chelsea have Cerebral Palsy which makes limits their range of motion. They use grabbers to help them extend their range of motion but are looking for something that is able to pick up small items and help in more specific tasks.

## Team 5 - Kristi

**Team Lead: Addy Novak & Lauren Grohowski**<br>

Kristi, a returner from the 2021 Makethon, is a Vanderbilt Next Steps alum. She works at the Nashville Zoo, and uses a reverse walker to get around. She has to carry around scanners, radios, pens, and a water bottle at work, but doesn't have a secure place to put them. Kristi wanted a removable basket for her walker with adjustable dividers, hooks, and a waterproof covering.

{% include gallery id="gallery5" %}

Team 5 modified a metal mesh container to function as Kristi's basket. The team laser cut custom acrylic dividers and 3D printed an adaptive cup holder. They also screwed hooks to the outside of the basket. To address Kristi's waterproofing needs, a waterproof fabric was sewn to a retractable car windowshade, which was attached to the top edge of the basket. Kristi can pull this cover over her basket and secure it with velcro when it is raining outside. Lastly, Team 5 created sticker magnets to decorate the basket! The basket is clamped to Kristi's walker and easily removed when she gets in the car. The basket documentation can be found here: [Reverse Walker Basket Documentation](https://tomglobal.org/project?id=6362ea6c8694e636371859bf).

## Team 8 - Hugh

**Team Lead: Eliza Hill**<br>

xx
Hugh Lang is a 7 year-old boy with clubbed arms, four fingers on his right hand, and three fingers on his left hand.


Why?

Since he doesnâ€™t have thumbs, Hugh mainly uses his pinky fingers. However, this means that a normal computer mouse is not very practical for him. He can either move the mouse or click on it, but cannot do both at the same time.



{% include gallery id="gallery8" %}

xx
How?

By separating the buttons from the mouse, this design presents a two-handed system. Hugh will be able to press the buttons and move the mouse simultaneously.


What?

The solution is a redesign of a traditional mouse that consists of a mouse for cursor movement and a box that has three buttons on it, one for right-clicking, one for left-clicking, and one for scrolling. This system uses USB to connect to any computer.

## Team 9 - Mary Cayten

Many people with disabilities need to use a straw to drink from a cup. However, straws are becoming increasingly difficult to find in restaurants, or people can often be shamed when they ask for one because of the perceived environmental impact straws have. The challenge is to develop a portable straw bracelet that is both fashionable and functional.
