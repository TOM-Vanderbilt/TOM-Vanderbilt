# About

This year, we hosted over 75 participants, including Makers, Need Knowers, and Team Leads, at our 5th annual Makeathon. We had 10 teams working throughout the weekend to prototype solutions for their Need Knowers.<br><br>

The weekend culminated in a showcase where each team was able to present about the work they completed. Read more about the 2022 Makeathon projects below!
