# Projects

## Team 1 - Liam

**Team Lead: Charlotte Lichtenfeld**<br>

Liam is a 7-year-old with Kleefstra Syndrome, which causes communication difficulties and hypotonia. He is not have a way to feed himself independently. Liam needed adapted silverware to hold his food. Additionally, his family needed a portable diaper-changing space that allows for privacy on long road trips.

{% include gallery id="gallery1" %}

Team 1 adapted silverware such that it would securely hold food even when turned sideways. They also made a magnetic privacy drape (Buceee's themed!) that could attach to his family's car, allowing for the trunk to be used as a private changing space.

{% include gallery id="gallery1g" %}


## Team 2 - Robby

**Team Lead: Kaiser Williams**<br>

Robby, a Vandy alum, was in a freak car accident in 2022 that left him with a C4/C5 spinal cord injury. He has little movement below his mid-shoulders. He works remotely full time, and uses a bluetooth gyroscope headmouse to help him interface with his computer. His current head mouse was causing pressure injuries to the bridge of his nose due to the weight and fit. Robby needed a more comportable and durable head mouse that enabled him to left and right click.

{% include gallery id="gallery2" %}

Team 2 designed a durable and comfortable computer/phone navigation tool that Robby can have for his work and daily use of technology. This device included a mouth switch mounted to the headband, allowing him to use left and right clicks. The head mouse documentation can be found here: [Gyroscope Integrated Computer Navigation Tool Documentation](https://tomglobal.org/project?id=651058dded09cf6fe1bd3142).

{% include gallery id="gallery2g" %}


## Team 3 - Jameson

**Team Lead: Abbie Wollheim**<br>

Jameson, a returner from the 2022 Makeathon, is a 7-year-old elementary school student with pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS). He has a service dog, Sushi, who helps keep him safe. However, Jameson often elopes, dropping his dog's leash. Jameson needed a way to stay incentivised to stay with Sushi.

{% include gallery id="gallery3" %}

Team 3 created a new vest for Sushi. The vest included an inproved handle grip for Jameson, as well as velcro patches that Jameson could add his favorite characters to. Team 3 also prototyped a light-up feature that would flash green (Jameson's favorite color) when he held onto the leash. The service dog vest documentation can be found here: [Harness Helper Documentation](https://tomglobal.org/project?id=6362ead68694e636371859d7).

{% include gallery id="gallery3g" %}


## Team 4 - Oscar

**Team Lead: Jillian Hornby**<br>

Oscar is an avid road cycler who had a hemorrhagic stroke that caused the right side of his body to lose some functionality. His right leg has regained a lot of mobility, but his lower right arm is still unable to move. Oscar needed a way to change the gears on this bike without the use of his right hand.

{% include gallery id="gallery4" %}

Team 4 adapted Oscar's bike to move the gear changer to the left side of the bike. This allows Oscar to change the gears on his bike using his left hand.

{% include gallery id="gallery4g" %}


## Team 5 - Helen

**Team Lead: Abby Johnson**<br>

Helen is a 7-year-old with epilepsy and cerebral palsy. She has seizures on a daily basis. Helen has a swatting station, but it is neither strong nor portable for when she is in her wheelchair or bed. Helen needed a way to play with toys and music independently that would allow her to direct her movements towards the toys. 

{% include gallery id="gallery5" %}

Team 5 created an adjustable and padded swatting station that could be attached to Helen's wheelchair or medical bed. This device allows Helen to play with her favorite toys independently and safely. 

{% include gallery id="gallery5g" %}


## Team 6 - Susanna

**Team Lead: Elizabeth Walther**<br>

Susanna is a 5-year-old with an undiagnosed condition. She is non-verbal, in a wheelchair, and struggles with seizure-like activity. Susanna loves bells and chimes, but the only accessible chime structure is at a playground near her house. Susanna needed a way to play with musical toys in her different seating positions. 

{% include gallery id="gallery6" %}

Team 6 created a height-adjustable music station that Susanna can play with independently. It includes recorded music buttons, a rain stick spinner, desk bells, and a magic-touch drum set that she could play with in her wheelchair. It also included hanging bells she could swat when laying on the ground. This project was continued into the 2024 Global Innovation Challenge. Its documentation can be found here: [Adjustable Music Station Documentation](https://tomglobal.org/project?id=650f2d0fed09cf6fe1bcd530).

{% include gallery id="gallery6g" %}


## Team 7 - Michelle

**Team Lead: Erica Guelfi**<br>

Michelle is a Vanderbilt graduate student who is an ambulatory wheelchair user. She recently has needed to start using a motorized wheelchair, but is not strong enough to lift the 50 pound wheelchair into the trunk of her car. Current solutions are only designed for larger vehicles (vans). Michelle needed a light-weight, sturdy, and collapsible ramp that will allow Michelle to travel with her new wheelchair in her sedan. 

{% include gallery id="gallery7" %}

Team 7 created a folding wheelchair ramp that attaches to the back of Michelle's car to allow her to push her chair into the trunk independently once she disengages the motor. The ramp is strong enough to support the weight of Michelle's wheelchair, while also being small enough to fit in the trunk alongside her wheelchair.

{% include gallery id="gallery7g" %}


## Team 8 - Jackson

**Team Leads: Hadley Rossignol & Morgan Young**<br>

Jackson is a 19-year-old who was in a car accident in 2021, resulting in a traumatic brain injury. He has double vision that his glasses cannot completely correct, leading to uneven head symmetry. Jackson is able to practice head leveling during his physical and occupational therapy sessions, but needed a way to practice head leveling while at home. 

{% include gallery id="gallery8" %}

Team 8 created head-mounted laser that clips onto glasses and projects a cross onto a wall. When paired with an external cross projector, Jackson is able to adjust his head tilt so that the two crosses align. This device was recreated and provided to the Pi Beta Phi Rehabilitation center, allowing other neurologically impaired patients the opportunity to use the device in therapy sessions. The team also prototyped an app that utilized the accelerometers in AirPods to visually display the user's current head tilt. The app could be running in the background, allowing for notifications to be sent when the user's head was greater than 10 degrees off symmetry. The glasses clip-on documentation can be found here: [Head Tilt Sensor Documentation](https://tomglobal.org/project?id=65106472ed09cf6fe1bd55e4).

{% include gallery id="gallery8g" %}


## Team 9 - Kate & Pi Beta Phi Rehabilitation Center

**Team Lead: Kaitlyn Hannon**<br>

Kate, a physical therapist at the Pi Beta Phi Rehabilitation Center, works with patients who have difficulty lifting and advancing their leg during gait training post-stroke. This lead to the shoe of the weak leg dragging on the floor, creating a fall risk. Kate currently uses an empty tissue box cut in half to decrease friction on a shoe's toe box, but it is not durable. Kate needed a durable, resuable solution that could work with various shoe sized to decrease friction between a patient's foot and the floor. 

{% include gallery id="gallery9" %}

Team 9 created a 3D printed "sled" that the patient could velcro strap to their foot. The 3D printed material reduces friction between a patient's shoe and the floor. The design includes a toe rocker shape, which helps patients to feel more confident applying weight to their non-dominant leg. The design also includes a detachable elastic strap that can pull the patient's toe upwards, reducing the fall risk associated with foot drop. The foot drop documentation can be found here: [Shoe Drop Documentation](https://tomglobal.org/project?id=650fd5b6ed09cf6fe1bd1b98).

{% include gallery id="gallery9g" %}


## Team 10 - Mary Cayten

**Team Lead: Bryne Knowles**<br>
 
Mary Cayten has Elhers-Danlos Syndrome, a condition that affects her connective tissue and requires her to use mobility aids occasionally. She currently has a rollator and a cane, but neither are practical for her work environment. Mary Cayten wanted a collapsible cane that is lightweight, has interchangeable heads, and stands up on its own. She also needed a foldable walker. 

{% include gallery id="gallery10" %}

Team 10 adapted a cane and a walker to be more fashionable, including gold shimmer spray paint and an upholstered walker seat. The cane was able to stand up on its own, collapse, and have interchangeable heads. The walker was foldable, and also featured a cup holder!

{% include gallery id="gallery10g" %}


## Team 11 - Hugh

**Team Lead: Ryder Li**<br>

Hugh, a returner from the 2022 Makeathon, is a young boy with clubbed hands. He has trouble grabbing and holding onto things. Hugh needed a comfortable, adatable grabber that would allow him to pick up various objects. Hugh also needed a way to hold down paper when he is writing and drawing.

{% include gallery id="gallery11" %}

Team 11 created a grabber Hugh could trigger with his hands to allow Hugh to grab different items. They also created a a magnetic writing pad so that Hugh could write freely without worrying about holding down the paper.

{% include gallery id="gallery11g" %}


## Team 12 - Mathias

**Team Lead: Nicole Hill**<br>

Mathias is a 14-year-old boy. Due to strep that turned septic, he had all four of his limbs amputated. Mathias is a big gamer, but no longer has the ability to use traditional controllers because he has no fingers. He has tried Xbox's Adaptive Controller, but it is not sensitive enough. Mathias needed an adapted gaming setup that allows him to enjoy his favorite games again. Additionally, Mathias lost a lot of independence due to his amputations. He needed a way to eat, write, and use his phone without assistance.

{% include gallery id="gallery12" %}

Team 12 modified a Meta Quest 3?? so that Mathias could hold and access the buttons on the Oculus controllers. They also created a custom set-up consisting of 3D printed buttons and joysticks that Mathias could plug into his gaming computer to play Steam games. To address Mathias's independence desires, Team 12 created a 3D printed, flexible limb attachment that enabled different attachments to be clicked in. They made one attachment to hold silverware, one attachment to hold pencils/pens/markers, and one stylus attachment. With a "key" clamped to a table, Mathias is able to switch between attachments independently. Both the gaming set-up and the limb attachment device were continued into the 2025 Global Innovation Challenge. The gaming set-up documentation can be found here:[Modular Accessible Gaming Controller Documentation](https://tomglobal.org/project?id=65e112d4c360e6292908a087). The limb attachment documentation can be found here:[Limb Attachment with Interchangeable Implements Documentation](https://tomglobal.org/project?id=65e4e33bc360e62929090fa4).

{% include gallery id="gallery12g" %}


## Team 13 - Alicia??

**Team Lead: Blake Wolf**<br>

Hugh is a young boy with clubbed hands. He is currently unable to ride a bike since he can't comfortably hold onto the handlebars. He also has a hard time removing and putting back on marker caps when he draws. Lastly, he doesn't have winter gloves that fit him properly. Hugh needed a bike handlebar adaptation, a marker cap grip, and adapted winter gloves.

{% include gallery id="gallery13" %}

Team 13 3D-printed bike handlebar adaptations that gave Hugh an easier way of holding to the handlebars. They also created two different marker cap grip options that allowed Hugh to remove marker caps using his arms. Lastly, they sewed him custom Star Wars-themed winter gloves that he could put on independently. The marker cap grip project was continued into the 2025 Global Innovation Challenge. The bike handlebar adaptation documentation can be found here:[Bike Adaptation Documentation](https://tomglobal.org/project?id=66fdd3356b078200139914fd).
