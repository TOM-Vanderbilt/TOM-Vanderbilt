# About

This year, we hosted our second annual Toy Adaptation event! We hosted both an advanced and a beginner adaptation session, and had over 50 students come to switch-adapt toys. They learned skills in soldering, circuit boards, and sewing as they opened each toy and rewired the internal switches to larger 3D printed external switches.

By the end of the event, around 50 toys (15 plastic and 35 plush) were switch-adapted, providing an accessible way for children with hand mobility difficulties to play. A majority of the toys were donated to the Susan Gray School on Vanderbilt's campus. Here, children with disabilities and typically developing children play and learn alongside one another.<br><br>
